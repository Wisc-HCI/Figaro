Installation instructions to get the microcontroller code running on your LINUX machine:

1. Install CircuitPython BLE Library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE/

However, you will also need to:
- Use Python 3.7 (only version I got it to work with)
- Install CircuitPython libraries: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle
- Install _bleio for Blinka: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_bleio
  _bleio dependencies:
	- Bluez (version 5.48): https://learn.adafruit.com/install-bluez-on-the-raspberry-pi/installation
	- Bleak: https://github.com/hbldh/bleak
